## 📝Contributions
If you would like to contribute to this project, you can but they more than likely will not be accepted as of right now because I plan on restructing the entire project because it just a big mess and very difficult to understand.

## Reason for Creating this Project
I created this Project because I used to use an app very similar to this, the app is called VRY (Valorant Rank Yoinker). The app worked fine and did everything that this project does but I constantly faced issues where the app would not open at times and took too long to display the data. This project now displays the data almost instantly and would open 9/10 times, the slight factor where it does not open is due to a bug.

## 🚦Status
Below are a list of major things I plan on adding to the project or are currently in development alongside bugs that can affect the experience of the app / project.

### 🆕Upcoming Features
- [ ] [Show Peak Ranks](https://github.com/ignshifts/ValorFetchR/issues/1)
- [ ] [Show Party Queue](https://github.com/ignshifts/ValorFetchR/issues/2)
- [ ] [View Equipped Cosmetics](https://github.com/ignshifts/ValorFetchR/issues/5)

### 🐛Major Bugs
- [ ] [PUUID being in other fields.](https://github.com/ignshifts/ValorFetchR/issues/11)

*There are WAY more things but these are just the major ones, you can view the entire list from the [Issues](https://github.com/ignshifts/ValorFetchR/issues) tab.*

## 🔨 Bannable?
This project does probably two things Riot may not like which is displaying the hidden names of users in Streamer Mode & showing what side you will be on from Agent Select. Nonetheless, it's very unlikely you will get banned for this because these are not really advantageous things and are stuff you will end up finding out later. I'm going to say it's not bannable but use at your own risk.

### ✨Fun Fact: This is my 3rd time making this project again! The other times I have gotten close to doing it but I gave up due to how stressful it was to test everything but I decided to stop being lazy.✨
