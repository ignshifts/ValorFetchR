## 📝Contributions
If you would like to contribute to this project, you can but they more than likely will not be accepted as of right now because I plan on restructing the entire project because it just a big mess and very difficult to understand.

## 🐜 Bug Reports
Please keep in mind there are a decent amount of bugs within this project but it is very much usable. If you get a error message, you can simply just close the program and reopen it, it will work fine. If you would like to help me debug this entire project it would be very much appreciated if you could create a [Issue](https://github.com/ignshifts/ValorFetchR/issues), with the full stack trace of the error or even a screenshot that just shows the relevant error that would be fine. Please make sure that you mention what happened before the error happened so I can effectively reproduce it and resolve it. You can also report the error privately in the project support server.

## Reason for Creating this Project
I created this Project because I used to use an app very similar to this, the app is called VRY (Valorant Rank Yoinker). The app worked fine and did everything that this project does but I constantly faced issues where the app would not open at times and took too long to display the data. This project now displays the data almost instantly and would open 9/10 times, the slight factor where it does not open is due to a bug.

## 🚦Status
Below are a list of major things I plan on adding to the project or are currently in development alongside bugs that can affect the experience of the app / project.

### 🆕Upcoming Features

## 🔨 Bannable?
This project does TWO things Riot may not like which is displaying the hidden names of users in Streamer Mode & showing what side you will be on from Agent Select. Nonetheless, it's very unlikely you will get banned for this because these are not really advantageous things and are stuff you will end up finding out later. If you obviously say a hidden persons name in chat you may get banned but you should have enough common sense to not do that. Other than that I'm going to say it's not bannable but use at your own risk.

### ✨Fun Fact: This is my 3rd time making this project again! The other times I have gotten close to doing it but I gave up due to how stressful it was to test everything but I decided to stop being lazy.✨
